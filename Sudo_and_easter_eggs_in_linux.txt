
Easter eggs in Linux(ubuntu)
Sometimes we get bored of studying and coding, then we need something for fun.

Ubuntu has not been left out. Some truly amusing Easter Eggs have been created for our beloved operating system over the years. Here are some of the easter eggs -- with how to achieve them.

1. Apt-get Cows

On Ubuntu, the apt-get package manager has had an embedded easter egg for a long time now.

To see your easter egg, first login to your ubuntu virtual machine and type the below commands in the terminal. I will not add the screenshot :) try yourself.

sudo apt-get moo


2. Aptitude Cows

With apt-get's affinity for cows, users may be curious as to whether aptitude(run the command sudo apt install aptitude if aptitude is not installed), another apt tool, also implements a fun easter egg.

Log into your Ubuntu virtual machine and try this

aptitude moo
Now add verbosity (-v) in command and the check the output.

aptitude -v moo
and you are not satisfied with above answer then add one more v in command.

aptitude -vv moo
You can continue adding v until you find something interesting.



3. Fun with Cowsay and Fortune

If you need some more cheap amusement at the command line and didn't get your fill of cows from the "apt" easter egg, you can download cowsay and fortune.

Log into your ubuntu virtual machine and type the below command to install cowsay and fortune.

sudo apt-get install fortune cowsay
Cowsay inserts any input into a word bubble and draws an ASCII cow to talk to you:

cowsay "hello, I don't know who am I ?" 
The fortune program spits out quotations, fortunes, jokes, nonsense that can be piped into cowsay:

Type the below command.

fortune  | cowsay 
If you're not too fond of cows, you can get other characters as well:

fortune | cowsay -f tux
